	<h1>nymea</h1>
	<p>nymea is an open source IoT stack. It is used to build smart IoT devices, smart home gateways or enable individual IoT related features in connected products. We follow a "local first" approach, which means nymea will keep users data private and will still be functional even without Internet connection. Obviously, cloud integration is still available if wanted.</p>

	<h2>Built for connected devices</h2>
	<p>Connect lighting, media, heatings, irrigations and sprinklers, garage doors, alarm systems and many more to a centralized, local and privacy focused control center with nymea. Or build your device running nymea to connect and integrate with other solutions, such as Alexa or Google Home.</p>

	<h2>Affair of the heart</h2>
	<p>We think that IoT devices, especially inside your home do not have to be cloud connected all the time. Privacy and reliability are our main concerns. With that in mind we build anything we do with a offline-first approach. This results in blazing fast reaction times, full control over personal data and guarantees your product won't be rendered useless if the cloud provider you've been betting on shuts down their service.
