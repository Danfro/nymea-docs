This is an tutorial to show the very basic concept of nymea plugins. You will learn how to setup the plug-in file structure, install the plug-in in nymea and you will be able to toggle a button inside the nymea:app.


Lets say we want to create a Button device, called Simple button, 
which has a press Action and emits an Event called pressed when someone executes the press Action.

Based on this Event we can create a rule and we have a virtual button which can be connected to any 
Action available in the entire system.
