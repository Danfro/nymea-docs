# Generic elements

The generic elements plugin allows you create virtual buttons, which can be connected with a rule. This gives you
the possibility to execute multiple actions with one signal. Without a rule this generic elements are
useless.

## Toggle Button
With the "Toggle Button" you can create a button with one action toggle. In the `state` you can find out,
what happens if the button will be pressed. The states can be true or false.

## Button
With the "Button" you can create a button with one action `press`. This button just creates one event.

## ON/OFF Button
With the "ON/OFF Button" you create a button pair with the actions `ON` and `OFF`.
