Now that nymea is up and running it's time to add some things to it, such as devices or services. Adding new things 
is done from the main menu in the *Configure things* view. From there, select the `+` button in the upper right 
corner and pick the type of thing to add.

For example, adding a TP-Link Kasa smart plugin would be done like this:

After the thing has been added, it will appear in the main screen. In this case a power socket that can be switched 
on and off, and a smart meter that allows to monitor the power consumption on the smart plug.
