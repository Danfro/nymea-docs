# Daylight sensor

A simple daylight "sensor". Works offline, just like that, no hardware required.

During setup, a one time geolocation lookup is performed using local network's public IP address. After that, the plugin calculates sunset and sunrise for your location completely offline.

This comes in handy for setting up rules, e.g. automatically turn on lights at sunset.
